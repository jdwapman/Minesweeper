1) Download all files to a folder on your hard drive.

2) Navigate to the program directory in a terminal application.

3) To compile the file, type "make" in the command line from within the program folder.

4) Run the program by typing ./mine_sweeper.out [#Rows #Columns #Mines (Optional) Random Seed]
    
    Note: This program was designed to work on Linux and OSX. Results in Windows may vary.

     ex: ./mine_sweeper.out 10 20 12
     ex: ./mine_sweeper.out 20 20 14 5
     
5) Due to restrictions when creating this game, input formatting must exactly match the pattern # #

Ex: 
There are 10 mines left
9 # # # # # # # # # #
8 # # # # # # # # # #
7 # # # # # # # # # #
6 # # # # # # # # # #
5 # # # # # # # # # #
4 # # # # # # # # # #
3 # # # # # # # # # #
2 # # # # # # # # # #
1 # # # # # # # # # #
0 # # # # # # # # # #
  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
Enter row a row between 0-9 and a column between 0-9: 4 5

Any other input formatting will result in an error. This is a limit of the programming guidlines at the time of creation.

When playing, the user has several options
0: Reveal. This reveals a tile and displays a number representing the number of adjacent mines
1: Question. This is purely a tool for the user to mark the locations of suspected tiles.
2: Mark. If you suspect you have found a mine, mark its location.
3: Cancels your action.

To win the game, succesfully mark the location of every mine on the game board.
